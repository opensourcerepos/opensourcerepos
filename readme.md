## About

OpenSourceRepos is an initiative to help developers contribute to open source repositories. Many developers face the issue like

- Not knowing the architecture of open source project
- Not knowing what best practices have they followed
- Not having the code walkthrough of the project

OpenSourceRepos aims to solve that by providing a platform for developers to write blogs about the architecture/best practices/code walkthrough of the open source projects they contribute to. The benefits of this are many.

- It helps other developers understand the architecture of the open source project. The developers can use this architecture for their own project as well.

- It helps them understand the tools that are used in open source project.

- It helps them understand the best practices followed in open source project. Again, the developers can use these best practices in their own project/work project.
